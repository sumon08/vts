Welcome To the code base a VTS (Vehicle Tracker Solution).

This project started as a smart vehicle tracker where some smart feature like data filtration to improve accuracy of location
Inertia navigation system integration, auto home recognition, frequent drive way generation and improve location based 
on thats data. This implementation also aim to provide system upgrade module to module. We planned to provide Firmware Over the Air


This project development is now paused for some reason. I am putting this in here so if I get time to start again to finish it.

This project use NuttX-7.25 as a kernel. NuttX is POSIX compliance RTOS for ARM CortexM controller. It can run on both Micro-Controllerontroller 
where MMU isn't present and also in Microprocessor where MMU present. If MMU available it support process like Linux.
Any Linux developer can write code on this platform easily.

Now NuttX development shift Under Apache. You can find it in Apache Eco-system.
